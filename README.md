# Stocks Value and Moving Average in Python
A Python code that imports a list of stocks (I used all companies that composes the Ibovespa, the Brazilian index) and exports a CVS with the price and a JPG with the graphics.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Family search is an amazing tool to find more about yourself. The main problem is that you can only load one image, if you are looking for your old relatives, maybe you will have to look for thousands of files to find a birth certificate.
This code just helps you to load all the images faster.
IMPORTANT: You shouldn't use the download function, Family Search can identify you as a robot if you are using this function.


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Find the book in family search that you want to load or download and paste in the URL field in python file. Also put your user and pass.
Choose what you want to do and run the code.

### Prerequisites

A browser and an account in http://familysearch.org/

1. Install Webdriver and Selenium
